One of my favourite quotes is this one by Margaret Mead -
“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed
individuals can change the world. In fact, it's the only
thing that ever has." - I truly believe the Bangalore Chess
Club is a great example of what a few committed individuals
can accomplish! They have and continue to rapidly create a
vibrant chess community in Bangalore!
