Bangalore Chess Club has been a remarkable part of my
6-year-old's chess learning journey. The organizers' warmth
and support have made the weekend meet-ups memorable. My son
eagerly anticipates every event, where he not only hones his
chess skills but also makes new friends. This club is more
than just a place to play; it's a nurturing community that
encourages growth and fun.
