Bangalore Chess club meet ups are a great way for chess lovers to meet and
play games. They are organised very meticulously by a small group of highly
motivated individuals. The event provides great learning opportunities for
youngsters to prepare for FIDE rated events. Kudos to BCC for giving great
platform for Bangalore chess players to collaborate.
