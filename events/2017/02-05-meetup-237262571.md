## Event Details
We'll be organizing a small tournament this time around. The entry is Rs. 50 and the winner gets all. So if we have 5 people coming then the winner will get 5 x 50 = Rs. 250. Obviously we will be meeting to play some good chess and meet fellow chess enthusiasts. But having a small tournament will make it all the more fun. 

## Pre-requisites
1. Please bring a chess board and a chess clock if you have one.
1. We will manage with chess clock app if there is shortage of clocks and if there are more people coming. So please download the same.
1. Please be familiar with fide tournament rules. And the rules of chess like En-passant, castling long and short, etc

Tournament will be 5 min Blitz games with 10 seconds increment for each move. The tournament will start by 3.30 pm in the amphitheater in freedom park. We're organizing a meetup after a very long time but this time we hope to keep it going every weekend. We'll soon start hosting themed tournaments. Keep an eye on this group about the same.
