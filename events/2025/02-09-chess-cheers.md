Step into the ultimate Hand & Brain edition of Chess & Cheers at Uru Brewery! 
This event celebrates teamwork, creativity, and quick thinking like never before! In this special format, one partner becomes the “Brain,” calling out the type of piece to move, while the other, the “Hand,” brings the strategy to life on the board.
It's a game of trust, laughter, and surprises, where collaboration is the key to victory.
