## Event Details
Weare going to restart regular chess meetups and we are going back to our roots. Our first ever Chess meetup was held at Freedom Park almost 4 years back. It has been a splendid journey and we hope to make it even more splendid going forward.
Here's what you need before coming:
1. A chessboard
1. The chess clock app installed on your phone
[Chess Clock]([Chess Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chess.clock))

We will start at 4 pm and go on till 6 pm. The timer will be set for 5 minutes + 2-second increments.

This is just a meetup to meet & greet fellow chess enthusiasts from the city. There is no age restriction. All are welcome!
