## Event Details
We are going to organize meetups on a weekly basis on Sundays from here on out.

## What to Bring

Please bring a chess board and if you have a chess clock, all the better. Last time we had only one board and most of us were waiting for our turn to play. Also please bring some money if you want to have your cup of coffee while playing.

## Agenda

Ideally we would start playing from 3:30 PM onwards up to 6:30 PM. But we may also end up playing longer if the games are interesting and fun.
