It's been a while since the last meetup. This would be the third one. Hopefully we'll be meeting up every other weekend or so.
Here are some things you need to bring:
1. A chessboard and a clock. (so we do not have any shortage of chess boards.)
2. Some money for the coffee. The idea of this meetup is to meet chess enthusiasts in the city and enjoy playing the game with each other.
Hope to see you guys there.
My number is  in case you have any problems finding the place.

The following week we'll start organizing tournaments to make the meetups more interesting. Also try installing the chess.com app. It's got a in built chess clock which would be handy when playing bullet games. Cheers
