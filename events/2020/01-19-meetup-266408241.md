## Event Details
Welcome to Bangalore Chess Club! ~ A place to meet, greet fellow chess enthusiasts from Namma Bengaluru.

We conduct tournaments in the third week of every month at Freedom Park. You will easily find Freedom Park on Google Maps which is only a 10-minute walk from the closest metro station Sir M. Visveshwaraya metro station. Plus there is parking at the entrance of Freedom Park. So there is absolutely no excuse for you not to come!

Here's what you need before coming:
1. A chessboard
1. The chess clock app installed on your phone [Chess Clock]([Chess Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chess.clock))
1. A bottle of water & some snacks to keep your energy level high during the games.

We will start at 4 pm and go on till 6 pm. The timer will be set for 5 minutes + 2-second increments.

This is just a meetup to meet & greet fellow chess enthusiasts from the city. There is no age restriction and there is no entry charges. All are welcome!
