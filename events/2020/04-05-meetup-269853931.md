## Event Details
Welcome to Bangalore Chess Club! ~ A place to meet, greet fellow chess enthusiasts from Namma Bengaluru.

Due to the current Covid Situation, we have stopped conducting our monthly Chess Tournaments at Freedom Park. But with new obstacles, come new opportunities.

We have started our Weekly Tournaments every Sunday from 6-7PM.

We just want to gather everyone virtually for an hour-long tournament where all our pros and amateurs can participate and have some fun. The tournament will be held every week on Sunday.

You can join now by clicking on the link and queue for the tournament.

PS. Beserking is allowed so if you really want to assert your domination why not split your time in half and earn that extra point for the win. Join in early so that we can have low waiting times and ensure maximum participation.
